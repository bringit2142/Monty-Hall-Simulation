# Monty-Hall-Simulation
We  will  be  writing  two  scripts,  one  script  (named  monty_hall.py)  which  simulates  the  Monty  Hall Problem  given  different  conditions  that  we  determine  (number  of  times  that  we  play  the  game, whether or not we switch doors and how many doors there are). The other script (named visualization.py)  will  run  simulations  and  use  the  conditions  of  the  simulations  that  we  run,  as well  as  the  percentage  of  times  that  we  won  in  order  to  create  a  visualization  where  the  x  axis  is how many times we played the game, and the y axis is the win percentage.
